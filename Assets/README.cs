    // Should have at least 10 distinct PowerUps available for Demo

        // The majority of the other half should have noticeable and impactful feeling affects (break through pegs)
        // At least one should include a significant change in mechanics or look/feel of the game
    // Game should have an end state, run out of money, potentially other end states
    // Game should track the players High score and save it with their initials
